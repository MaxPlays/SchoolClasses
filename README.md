# SchoolClasses
Bukkit plugin for Bukkit user Mr_BelgiumGamer

This Bukkit Plugin was tested using the newest build of the Spigot 1.11.2 API. It adds school classes to your Minecraft Server. It was requested by the Bukkit user Mr_BelgiumGamer. Feel free to play around with my code but remember to keep the comments with my name inside in each class.
